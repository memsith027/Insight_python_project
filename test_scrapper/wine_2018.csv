There are notes of rich, ripe cherry, cola, black pepper and a woody, cedary spice.

84,MontGras 2016 Reserva Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),"Rubbery berry fruit aromas include notes of latex and scrambled eggs.

84,Odfjell 2016 Orzada Made With Organic Grapes Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Gaseous aromas blend with jammy berry fruit and baking spice scents on a nose that lacks elegance. This is quite heavy and blocky on the palate, with oversize tannins. Thick, dense blackberry flavors roll out on a tannic finish with no give. This comes from a poor vintage for red wines.

84,Pikorua 2017 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"There's bit of a rubbery cabbage quality to this wine that's overwhelming the fruit characters. When you do find the lemon and pineapple notes, they're lacking some freshness and come with a lot of acidity on the palate. Overall, the disjointed nature of this wine is hard to shake.

86,Santa Carolina 2017 Reserva Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),"Spiced cherry and currant aromas are basic but true for Pinot Noir.

85,Konrad 2017 Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"A reductive onion note initially masks this wine.

85,Las Colinas Del Ebro 2017 Garnatxa Blanca (Terra Alta),"Briny citrus and bell pepper aromas amount to a lightly pickled nose. This Garnacha Blanca is solid in feel but common.

85,San Pedro 2015 Tierras Moradas Carmenère (Maule Valley),"There's ripe and then there's overripe; this is closer to the latter than the former.

85,San Pedro 2017 1865 Selected Vineyards Chardonnay (Elqui Valley),"Briny, punchy white fruit and citrus aromas are oaky. On the palate, this Elqui Valley Chardonnay feels narrow and citrusy.

89,Fiddletown Cellars 2017 Sauvignon Blanc (Amador County),"Chalky aromas and flavors distinguish this bone-dry, refreshing and different wine.

88,Domaine du Roc des Boutires 2016  Pouilly-Fuissé,"Smooth and with a rounded character, this warm wine fully reflects the ripe vintage.

88,Emilio Moro 2016 El Zarzal Godello (Bierzo),"A gold-meets-tan color and chunky aromas of walnut oil and mature apple are less than overtly fruity and fresh. In the mouth, citric acidity is keeping this braced and balanced. Flavors of lightly salty nectarine and peach pit turn lemony and a touch bitter on a full finish. Drink now.

88,Koyle 2015 Royale Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Hard-edged aromas of mint, dark spice and earthy berry fruit are woodsy. A tight, rugged palate is saturated but rough.

88,Kula 2016 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Somewhat delicate on the nose, this bottling offers aromas of kirsch and spice cake to start.

88,Marisco Vineyards 2017 The Ned Pinot Gris (Marlborough),"Left for a spell on the skins, this pink-hued Pinot Gris could be easily mistaken for a rosé.

88,Messina Hof 2016 Private Reserve Double Barrel Tempranillo (Texas High Plains),"An earthy nose of lush green moss, ferns and tilled earth carries a subtle hint of wild blackberry.

88,Paul Cheneau NV Lady of Spain Brut Sparkling (Cava),"Briny lime aromas are slightly yeasty but mostly clean and fresh.

88,Peregrine 2016 Pinot Gris (Central Otago),"A little oniony, salty and reductive at the start, with some swirls in glass this wine offers delicate aromas of lemon and lime. Typical to this variety and style, its texture is creamy, woven nicely between crunchy—if a little austere—acidity and a salty bitter-almond finish. On the premium end both in price and style, this is one for the dinner table rather than for sipping solo.

88,Rod McDonald Wines 2016 Mister Chardonnay (Hawke's Bay),"This Hawke's Bay Chardonnay offers up a nose of citrus fruit and mango rind.

86,Gambino 2015 Tifeo Rosso  (Etna),"This has aromas of French oak, prune, underbrush and vanilla. Reflecting the nose, the lean, light-bodied palate evokes coconut, espresso and a hint of dried berry alongside dusty, rather fleeting tannins that leave a drying, astringent finish.

86,Bodega Volcanes de Chile 2016 Tectonia Chardonnay (Malleco),"Fully toasted oak aromas are smoky and grainy, and they cover up briny apple notes. A mix of oily weight and sharp acidity defines the palate, while this tastes a bit sour, with lots of oak attached to stone fruit flavors. Hailing from southerly Malleco, this is a cool-climate Chardonnay, and thus the high acid level makes sense.

86,Casa Donoso 2017 Bicentenario Gran Reserva Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Aggressive aromas of gamy berry fruits are slightly green.

90,William Chris 2015 Lost Draw Vineyards Mourvèdre (Texas High Plains),"Herbal aromas of bay leaves and hops are alluring on the nose of this Texas Mourvèdre. The extremely juicy palate dances on the firm structure of fine-grained tannins.

84,Calcu 2015 Reserva Especial Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Leafy berry aromas are lacking in purity, letting you know more or less where this is headed.

84,Cantine di Ora 2017 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),"Light-bodied and simple, this has subdued aromas suggesting mature orchard fruit.

84,Casas del Bosque 2016 Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"A gold color and a blowsy nose with oak but not much fruit or freshness form the opening to this shaky but decent Chardonnay. A chunky, pulpy palate and woody flavors of stale stone fruit and citrus finish with little more than a hint of vanilla.

84,Lewis Grace 2016 Barbera (Amador County),"A strong spicy oaky aroma is followed by equally strong oak flavors, so this medium-bodied wine is one-dimensional, without the fruit character that most people like to taste in their wines.

84,Marqués de Riscal 2017 Verdejo (Rueda),"Oily, slightly sweaty aromas of phenolic green fruits and peanuts raise some questions regarding quality.

83,Amalur 2016 Single Vineyard Reserva Pinot Noir (Colchagua Valley),"Grassy aromas include notes of green herb and bell pepper.

83,Carmen 2017 Wave Series Right Wave Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),"Dusty berry aromas are basic and bland. This feels creamy, sticky and candied.

83,Chilcas 2017 Reserva Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Lolol Valley),"Herbaceous notes of juniper and eucalyptus push the limits of what's acceptable in terms of green aromas.

83,Fitz Roy 2017 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"A yeasty nose is less than fresh and indicates a wine in decline. A grabby palate with the feel of grape skins tastes wheaty, grassy and fruitless.

83,Juvé & Camps 2017 Gregal D'Espiells White (Penedès),"This blend of Gewürztraminer, Malvasia and Muscat is highly aromatic but not at ease, meaning the nose is soapy and smells unnatural.

It's intensely rich, bursting with mulberry and cherry flavors, yet not brawny or dense. Finessed and fine in texture, it's marked by soft, chalky tannins and bright, sunny acidity.
