88,Aljibes 2014 Selectus Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Ripe aromas of blackberry, prune, vanilla and cola are a high point on this muscular blend from Albacete in warm central Spain. A soupy palate could be dismissed as too heavy and woody. Flavors of clove, chocolate and thick berries are minty, chocolaty and a bit hot on the finish. Lovers of massive reds will be happier than fans of leaner, more traditional Old World wines.

87,Cellers Unió 2016 Perlat Garnatxa (Montsant),"Ripe berry and plum aromas are thick and a bit strained. On the palate, this Grenache is tannic and rubbery in feel.

87,Encosta do Sobral 2015 Touriga Nacional (Tejo),"A powerfully rich, wood-aged wine, this exhibits a solid structure although the alcohol does show strongly.

87,Conveyance 2015 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The winery indicates this is a reserve, but that term is well hidden (if there at all) on the label.

84,Cantine di Ora 2017 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),"Light-bodied and simple, this has subdued aromas suggesting mature orchard fruit.

83,Carmen 2017 Wave Series Right Wave Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),"Dusty berry aromas are basic and bland. This feels creamy, sticky and candied. Flavors of clove and forced oak sit on top of limited red fruit notes, while confected flavors of clove, chocolate and vanilla stand out on a fruitless finish.

83,Château Rouquette 2014 La Tour aux Palombes  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"High-toast flavors still dominate this wine, although they should by now have melded into the fruit.

83,Chilcas 2017 Reserva Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Lolol Valley),"Herbaceous notes of juniper and eucalyptus push the limits of what's acceptable in terms of green aromas. A crisp palate with tomatoey acidity is fresh and punchy, while this tastes of herbal, saucy plum and currant. Tomato and green herb notes make the finish taste much like spaghetti sauce. ",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,https://253qv1sx4ey389p9wtpp9sj0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Michael_Schachner_300x450.jpg,12,Reserva Estate Bottled,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,Lolol Valley,Chile,Chilcas
83,Fitz Roy 2017 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"A yeasty nose is less than fresh and indicates a wine in decline. A grabby palate with the feel of grape skins tastes wheaty, grassy and fruitless. Low acidity on the finish confirms that this is fading.

83,Juvé & Camps 2017 Gregal D'Espiells White (Penedès),"This blend of Gewürztraminer, Malvasia and Muscat is highly aromatic but not at ease, meaning the nose is soapy and smells unnatural. A flat palate with no edge holds dull flavors of lychee and little else. On the finish, this turns bitter and oily.

94,Tantara 2016 Zotovich Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Broad aromas of white peach, gardenia, jasmine and butter are leveled by a sharp lemone note on the nose.

94,The Eyrie Vineyards 2015 Daphne Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This is a great vintage for this limited selection of old-vine Pommard clone Pinot Noir.

94,Brittan Vineyards 2015 Basalt Block Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"Brittan's wines may seem a bit austere when first opened, which is no fault in this instance.

On the tightly knit palate, taut yet polished tannins frame flavors of raspberry compote, black cherry, licorice, graphite and a hint of orange rind.

91,Adega Mayor 2013 Pai Chão Grande Reserva Red (Alentejano),"This wine is immense but manages to also have an elegant side. That comes from the fine balance between acidity and the concentrated black fruits from the Alicante Bouschet.

Acid-pushed dark-fruit flavors come with an offset of oaky vanilla, while this is clipped and gappy in feel on the finish. ",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,https://253qv1sx4ey389p9wtpp9sj0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Michael_Schachner_300x450.jpg,39,Crianza,Tempranillo,Ribera del Duero,,Northern Spain,Spain,Alvides
89,Ancien 2015 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Oregon),"The latest release of Oregon Pinot from this Napa Valley producer is done in a lush and creamy style, with flavors of raspberries, cherries and vanilla in abundance. It's forward and tasty, though rather lightly ripened throughout, and best consumed 2021–2025.

89,Billecart-Salmon NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne),"Crisp, dry and full of red-currant fruits and tight acidity, this is a delicious, young Champagne. It is textured and zesty, with layer of acidity vying with the perfumed fruit. This bottling really should age, so drink it from 2019. ",Roger Voss,@vossroger,https://253qv1sx4ey389p9wtpp9sj0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RogerVoss_CreditAlainBenoit_300x450.jpg,85,Brut Rosé,Champagne Blend,Champagne,,Champagne,France,Billecart-Salmon
89,Bodega Rolland 2014 Mariflor Pinot Noir (Mendoza),"Cocoa, cinnamon and oak aromas are more prominent than fruit on this ripe, full-bodied Pinot Noir. A hard-driving palate is not about elegance, acidity and restraint. Flavors of black cherry, mocha and chocolate are tasty but atypical of most Pinot Noirs. A peppery finish with heavy oak spice seals the deal on this uniquely Rolland-style wine.

89,Bruno Paillard NV Dosage Zéro  (Champagne),"While this producer's style is for dry Champagnes, this one is perhaps excessive. Even the ripe fruit can't quite take away the shocking acidity and intensity, making it best for those who like their Champagne to be seriously dry and tight. A few months more might help reduce the shock.

89,Château Tanunda 2014 The Château 100 Year Old Vines Shiraz (Barossa),"As the name suggests, this wine is from some seriously old, low-yielding vines. The liberal use of American and French oak, however, does mask the character of those old vines somewhat. It's dense and chocolatey, with plum, black pepper, vanilla and a dusting polish note throughout. The palate is plushly textured and warming, with soft, dusty tannins and a lingering peppery spice.

89,Cochon 2016 Les Sirenes Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Delicately layered and earthy, this wine takes on power as it opens in the glass, ending up in a full-bodied style of robust forest, cardamom and pomegranate. The structure is moderate in acidity.

89,Coelho 2016 Delfina Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"The best of the winery's 2016 vineyard selects, this well-defined wine has flavors of mulberry, sour plum and a touch of lemon. Aging in one-quarter new oak adds some pretty spices, and the overall concentration is enough to carry it for another half decade or so.

90,Planeta 2014 Menfi Burdese Red (Sicilia),"This blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Cabernet Franc opens with aromas of dark berry, bell pepper and tilled soil.

90,Planeta 2016 Frappato (Vittoria),"Heady aromas of ripe strawberry, red cherry, clove and white pepper follow over to the vibrant palate alongside supple, polished tannins. Bright acidity lends balance and gives it a crisp, juicy finish. Chill slightly for a perfect summer red.

90,Planeta 2017 Noto Allemanda White (Sicilia),"This expressive white opens with heady scents of apricot, rose and grapefruit that follow through to the savory palate along with peach, crushed herb and a mineral note suggesting sea salt. It closes crisp and clean.

90,Riley's Rows 2016 3x3 Red (North Coast),"This is a well-made blend of equal parts Merlot and Syrah, the wine smooth and brawny in a grip of leathery tannin, spicy cinnamon and pepper. It has a meaty profile complemented by tastes of dried herb, cedar and dark cherry.

90,Rock Wall 2016 Diego's Reserve Carmenère (Dunnigan Hills),"A leafy, minty streak adds interest to this nicely fruity, silky smooth and medium-bodied wine. It seems to melt in the mouth and coat the tongue with an almost jammy but not too heavy plum character that's easy to enjoy. ",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars,https://253qv1sx4ey389p9wtpp9sj0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jim_Gordon_BillReitzel_300x450.jpg,25,Diego's Reserve,Carmenère,Dunnigan Hills,Central Valley,California,US,Rock Wall
90,Rodney Strong 2014 Brothers Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"From a high-elevation site, this is a broadly structured, full-bodied wine, with strong elements of cedar, dried herb and brown sugar. A cherry jam flavor accents the luxuriously lush palate, ending on an earthy leather note. ",Virginie Boone,@vboone,https://253qv1sx4ey389p9wtpp9sj0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Virgine_Boone_300x450.jpg,75,Brothers,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,California,US,Rodney Strong
90,Roger et Didier Raimbault 2017 Les Belles Côtes  (Sancerre),"A ripe wine, full of apple and tropical fruit, this is a rich style of Sancerre.

90,Rowen 2015 Red (Sonoma County),"From a high-elevation site called Cooley Ranch, this combines 55% Cabernet Sauvignon with 26% Malbec, 17% Syrah and 2% Viognier. Clove, sage and peppercorn dot the smoothly textured palate, never holding back on the bold, juicy black-fruit flavor and the chocolate finish.

90,Saget la Perrière 2017 Domaine de la Perrière  (Sancerre),"This is the home domaine of what has become a large negociant house.

90,Salomon-Undhof 2016 Wolke Für Zwei Sparkling (Österreichischer Perlwein),"A naturally cloudy hue and some funky, still reduced yeast notes give a very honest impression of ripe grapes. The palate is light and dry, slightly sparkling and tangy, with a real, pervasive freshness. A lovely, honest Riesling-based pét-nat.

90,Skinner 2015 Petite Sirah (El Dorado),"A touch of violet in the aroma is about the only delicate thing in this deeply colored, intense and tannic wine. It shows a spicy oak influence, and has the varietal's usual inky hue, concentrated black-pepper and blackberry flavors and strong but well-integrated tannins. Best after 2023.

90,Soléna 2016 Prince Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Sourced from a vineyard planted in 1983, this displays ripe black fruits, silky tannins and enough acidity to balance out the finish. It spent 10 months in half new French oak. Though not especially big or ripe, it's balanced and lively and shows some interesting texture.

90,Stoller 2016 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Rich cherry fruit is punctuated with pungent, slightly bitter phenolics, sending streaks of herb and earth under well-ripened fruit flavors.

90,Tait Wines 2014 The Wild Ride Red (Barossa Valley),"Despite the steep 15.5% alcohol that adds some heat, this blend has a lot to offer. On the nose, ripe red currant and cranberry fruit mingles with more savory, earthy characters of green olive, tobacco and eucalyptus.

90,Van Loveren NV Christina Limited Release Méthode Cap Classique Brut Sparkling (Robertson),"This wine is pretty, fresh and toasty all at once. It opens with aromas of hazelnut brittle, toasted challah and grilled red apple, all of which carry through to the medium-weight palate alongside additional flavors of pie crust and peach pit. Voluptuous in feel, the rich tones are balanced by medium carbonation and bright orange- and lime-flecked acidity.

90,Weinreich 2016 Trocken Grauburgunder (Rheinhessen),"Aromas of honey and pears are marked by spice, cashew and hops in this deep gold Grauburgunder, or Pinot Gris. The palate is intensely fruity, almost tropical, boasting notes of pineapple and melon, but balanced by a deep mineral undertone and crisp acidity.

89,Marqués de Riscal 2012 Reserva  (Rioja),"Briary berry aromas are spicy but also earthy and a bit stewed. A chewy dense palate is more chunky than structured, while this tastes of charred wood and baked berry fruits. Given that 2012 was a very warm year, this is in good shape. Drink through 2022.

80,Black Box 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon (Chile),"Aromas of vanilla, asphalt and milk chocolate are infinitely more fake smelling than natural.

80,Landon 2015 Reserve Tempranillo (Texas High Plains),"Aromas of creosote introduce a neutral palate of petrol and red fruit flavors.

80,San Pedro 2016 1865 Limited Edition Syrah (Elqui Valley),"San Pedro's Elqui Valley Syrahs are always challenging. This version from a rainy El Niño vintage is difficult in many ways. The nose is like tomato soup infused with mint and grass. A stewy, syrupy palate is far from balanced and elegant, while this tastes green and tomatoey, with mint and canned pea notes on the finish.

100,Heidi Schröck 2015 Ruster Ausbruch Auf den Flügeln der Morgenröte Welschriesling (Burgenland),"On the nose, a hint of dark fir honey shows with a streak of its pleasant bitterness. Fresh notes of apple and lemon zest mix with the earthy notes of botrytis. On the palate, this zestiness unfolds completely, crashing with the full force of its fruit like roaring surf against a rock. That lovely element of noble bitterness still holds sway, creating a sensation of the most intense but also precise sweetness. Drink until 2040, at least.

100,Pol Roger 2008 Cuvée Sir Winston Churchill Brut  (Champagne),"One of the great Champagnes both for its richness and its longevity, this latest incarnation is superb. The wine's richness is linked to the ripe fruit and the dominance of Pinot Noir in the blend. It also shines in the perfect balance between the texture, the minerality and the integration of the fruit. It can be enjoyed now, but it will be better from 2020 and then for many years to come.

100,Kracher 2015 Zwischen den Seen Trockenbeerenauslese Nummer 4 Scheurebe (Burgenland),"An exquisitely floral honeysuckle aroma surrounds a creamy yet sharp note of passion fruit, while a peppery verve tingles around the edges. The palate has the same playful character: a floral tease here, a full-blown passion-fruit kiss there, a total embrace of sweetness balanced by a sure-footed command of acid that draws everthing together and assembles a newly precise picture with every sip. This is so heady, so delicious, so pure, so moreish that it should be a controlled substance. This should hold well through 2040, at least.

100,Kracher 2015 Zwischen den Seen Trockenbeerenauslese Nummer 8 Muscat Ottonel (Burgenland),"Damask rose, honeysuckle and blood orange peel unite in an almost otherworldly headiness. The palate keeps shimmering with these floral overtones while a solid wave of sweetness assails the taste buds with an insisting urgency, only to follow this with a sharp, welcome smack of pure lemon freshness. These notions alternate and fill the head with the pleasure of their tension. Sublime. Drink until 2040, at least.

The viscous liquid is of an unusual density, brimming at every atom with its barley sugar flavors and caramelized black tea leaf and citrus notes.

There almost is a fiery hit of ginger in the lip-smacking finish. A spicy magic potion here that lasts and lasts on the palate. Drink until 2040, at least.

98,Kracher 2015 Zwischen den Seen Trockenbeerenauslese Nummer 10 Scheurebe (Burgenland),"A hint of orange peel on the nose has the earthy tang of botrytis along with a leafy, slightly floral lift of honeysuckle. The concentrated sweetness that follows is cut by piercing, lively freshness that seems pervasive, and while cutting into the passion-fruit generosity it also defines and sharpens it.

98,Kracher 2015 Nouvelle Vague Trockenbeerenauslese Nummer 7 Chardonnay (Burgenland),"Marmalade, toffee, vanilla and tonka bean swirl on the nose. Rich and smooth, rounded and mellow, yet with an incredibly bright, aromatic core of fine citrus. Think dried and candied orange peel and candied blood orange.

89,Angove 2015 The Medhyk Old Vine Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"Made from 55-year-old vines in relatively small quantities, Angove's top wine is a classic South Aussie. It oozes ultraripe fruits that veer into blackberry jam territory at the moment. Behind all that fruit peeks cola, mocha and peppery spice.

88,Lujon 2017 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Though not as ripe as past vintages, this brings appealing flavors of cinnamon-dusted apple pie and poached pear.

90,Marqués de Riscal 2013 Baron de Chirel Reserva  (Rioja),"Fine oak helps an otherwise ripe and earthy nose.

93,Pflüger 2016 Dürkheimer Fronhof Trocken Pinot Noir (Pfalz),"Succulent black cherry and blackberry aromas juxtapose toast and smoke on the nose of this luscious, full-bodied Pinot Noir. Equal parts fruit and earth, its opulent black fruit flavors are accented by hints of beetroot, violet and anise.

93,Franz Keller 2016 Vom Löss Pinot Noir (Baden),"The nose of this wine is beautifully perfumed, suggesting whiffs of cherry blossom, graphite, plum and smoke.

85,Cruzat NV Cuvée Nature  (Uco Valley),"Yeasty aromas of lemon and apple are solid enough. This sparkler is fairly mellow in feel, with modest grip and acidity.

93,Bruno Paillard NV Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Extra Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"All this producer's wines are labeled Extra Brut, and therefore drier than Brut.

93,CVNE 2014 Imperial Reserva  (Rioja),"Imperial Reserva is a personal favorite, and from a vintage plagued by rain this is a swinging success. Rich aromas of maple are prominent, with solid berry fruit as the canvas.

93,Domaine Divio 2016 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Again in 2016 this is the ripest of the winery's Pinots, and it spent almost a year in one-third new French oak. The color is a plummy purple/red, and the well-integrated flavors mix red and blue fruits, with a light dusting of cocoa. The lingering finish adds streaks of mocha and caramel.

93,Johannishof 2017 Rüdesheimer Ramstein Trocken Riesling (Rheingau),"This dry, full-bodied wine has a density and weight that's seductive, but it feels a bit tight and closed now.

87,Avancia 2017 Cuvée de O Mencía (Valdeorras),"Heavy aromas of wood spice, schisty berry and seashell are loud but short on harmony. This Mencía feels plump and round, but low on acidity. Oaky, herbal berry flavors are roasted and minty, while this feels tannic and sticky on the finish.

87,Batasiolo 2014  Barolo,"Racy and linear, this has aromas suggesting underbrush, tobacco leaf, moist soil, camphor and a whisper of rose.

87,Bianchi 2015 Garey Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Cooked aromas of cherry, baking spice, vanilla and stewed plums show on the rather ripe and extracted nose of this bottling.

87,Bodegas Riojanas 2013 Viña Albina Reserva  (Rioja),"Gritty earthy aromas of raisiny fruit and asphalt are indicative of a drawing and gritty palate. Leafy notes of tomato vie with baked-fruit flavors, while this is clampy and lacks smoothness on the finish. Seems like 2013's cold conditions affected this wine.

The concentrations of both sweetness and acidity seem to potentiate each other, creating an increasing sense of joy, drama and thrill.

84,Kaiken 2016 Terroir Series Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec-Petit Verdot Red (Vista Flores),"Forced oak projects a burning sensation and a chemical note to the nose.

84,Carramimbre 2015 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Oaky, resiny aromas of wood grain and spice render fruit a secondary item. This is tight, raw and tough on the palate.

84,Finca la Celia 2016 Pioneer Cabernet Sauvignon (Uco Valley),"Gamy, foresty berry aromas lack purity but are not bad.

84,Hilanda 2016 Monastrell (Jumilla),"Top-heavy oak creates aromas of campfire, clove and maple. That same thick, oaky character is noted on a creamy palate.

84,Las Colinas Del Ebro 2016 Red (Terra Alta),"Murky aromas of compost, raspberry and pineapple are less than clean.

84,Maryhill 2017 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas don't seem entirely settled at present, showing some reductive notes. The palate is light, tart and tangy.

84,A Blooming Hill Vineyard 2016 Trouble Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"You'll have to look closely to spot the Trouble designation on the front label, which differentiates this from the estate's Gemini cuvée.

90,La Conreria d'Scala Dei 2010 Iugiter Red (Priorat),"Well into its run, this still smells of oak, but also dried, earthy berry fruits and schisty dust.

86,Chopo 2016 Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla),"Ripe berry and cassis aromas feature more than enough charred wood and licorice scents. A palate with raw tannins is tough to penetrate.

87,Marcelo Mira 2014 Pinot Noir (Patagonia),"Baked, rooty aromas of dried cherry and currant are mostly convincing. This feels rubbing and abrasive, while flavors of root beer and mocha are oaky and on top of shy fruit. Coffee and cappuccino flavors dominate a ripe finish.

92,Quinta do Sagrado 2012 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),"Traditional foot treading in lagars gives this wine its opulent character and generous black fruits.

A plummy purple hue, it's lightly scented with toast, sandalwood and cedar. Silky smooth in the mouth, it's a bowl of ripe blueberries, done in an elegant style.

92,Abacela 2015 Fiesta Tempranillo (Umpqua Valley),"Fiesta is the entry-level cuvée among four different Abacela Tempranillos. To say this wine overdelivers is to understate its impact. The estate-grown fruit sends up gamy scents that conjure dreams of blood sausage and lead down a deep, dark entryway into a core of blue plum, black cherry and cassis fruits. Some barrel time adds licorice and clove, with tannic muscle invigorating the finish.

90,Bruliam 2016 Rocky Ridge Zinfandel (Rockpile),"This is a hearty red, completely characteristic of its rough-hewn, mountain appellation, a study in crushed rock and elusive mineral elements.

83,Viña Bisquertt 2016 La Joya Gran Reserva Syrah (Colchagua Valley),"This Syrah seems to have been caught up in the rains of 2016. It smells distinctly raw and herbaceous, like olives in brine.

83,Bodegas Ondarre NV Selección Millennium Brut Sparkling (Cava),"A yellow color and doughy aromas of bread and applesauce are less than fresh.

89,Dobbes Family Estate 2016 Dundee Hills Cuvée Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Part of the winery's AVA Collection, this new release is the first of the 2016s. An unusual streak of pine sap enlivens the aromas, not harsh, but definitely present on the palate. There's blueberry and fig fruit as well, and the fig comes with a Newtonian crunch. Though not typical of this AVA in the heart of the Willamette Valley, it's an interesting and compelling wine nonetheless.

89,Domaine Laporte 2015 Les Grandmontains  (Sancerre),"A light Pinot Noir, this is soft, full of red-cherry flavors and silky tannins. The wine has a fresh feel while also offering plenty of ripe fruitiness, acidity and a refreshing, crisp aftertaste. Drink this gently structured, balanced wine from 2020.

89,Donnafugata 2015 Chiarandà  (Contessa Entellina),"Aromas of ripe orchard fruit, oak, toast and coconut lead the nose. On the enveloping palate, you'll find dried apricot, toasted oak, nut and a hint of crushed herb. Enjoy over the next few years to capture the remaining fruit richness.

89,Elizabeth Chambers 2015 Lazy River Vineyard Pinot Noir (Yamhill-Carlton),"Still tasting quite young, this tight, chewy wine seems to be in the midst of pulling itself together. Components of sour plum, wild cherry and green tea are in place, but the seamless ripeness of past vintages is not, at least for now.

89,Fairsing 2016 Sullivan Pinot Noir (Yamhill-Carlton),"Other than slight clonal variations in the three estate blends, there's little to differentiate the 2016 Pinots from Fairsing, at least at this young age. This has the same citrus component and wild blackberry fruit as the wine labeled Estate. Barrel aging for 10 months in 30% new French oak adds a touch of vanilla wafer.

89,Gyéjacquot Frères NV Anatom Blanc Vrai Brut  (Champagne),"This blend holds Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, the latter aged briefly in wood.

89,Huett 2017 Croft Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Willamette Valley),"This half-stainless- and half-neutral-oak-fermented wine takes a gentle approach to this variety.

89,Jean Laurent NV Cuvée Blanche Brut Pinot Blanc (Champagne),"It's often forgotten that Pinot Blanc is one of the permitted grapes in Champagne. Normally found in the Aube, it makes, as here, a wine softer than Chardonnay, with ripe white fruits and an open texture. This wine is attractive, fruity and ready to drink.

92,Jacquart NV Brut Mosaic Signature  (Champagne),"Aged five years on lees rather than the usual three years for Brut Mosaïque, this wine, spelled, confusingly Brut Mosaic, has greater depth and richness.

92,Purple Hands 2016 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Yamhill-Carlton),"Aromatic and balanced, Cody Wright's take on fruit from this classic vineyard hits all the right (no pun intended) notes. There are seams of blueberry pie, cola and a hint of minerality, excellent texture and length, and enough stiffness to the tannins to suggest holding off a bit on drinking it.

There are notes of rich, ripe cherry, cola, black pepper and a woody, cedary spice.

84,Odfjell 2016 Orzada Made With Organic Grapes Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Gaseous aromas blend with jammy berry fruit and baking spice scents on a nose that lacks elegance. This is quite heavy and blocky on the palate, with oversize tannins. Thick, dense blackberry flavors roll out on a tannic finish with no give. This comes from a poor vintage for red wines.

84,Pikorua 2017 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"There's bit of a rubbery cabbage quality to this wine that's overwhelming the fruit characters. When you do find the lemon and pineapple notes, they're lacking some freshness and come with a lot of acidity on the palate. Overall, the disjointed nature of this wine is hard to shake.

85,Konrad 2017 Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"A reductive onion note initially masks this wine.

85,Las Colinas Del Ebro 2017 Garnatxa Blanca (Terra Alta),"Briny citrus and bell pepper aromas amount to a lightly pickled nose. This Garnacha Blanca is solid in feel but common.

85,San Pedro 2015 Tierras Moradas Carmenère (Maule Valley),"There's ripe and then there's overripe; this is closer to the latter than the former.

89,Fiddletown Cellars 2017 Sauvignon Blanc (Amador County),"Chalky aromas and flavors distinguish this bone-dry, refreshing and different wine.

88,Domaine du Roc des Boutires 2016  Pouilly-Fuissé,"Smooth and with a rounded character, this warm wine fully reflects the ripe vintage.

88,Emilio Moro 2016 El Zarzal Godello (Bierzo),"A gold-meets-tan color and chunky aromas of walnut oil and mature apple are less than overtly fruity and fresh. In the mouth, citric acidity is keeping this braced and balanced. Flavors of lightly salty nectarine and peach pit turn lemony and a touch bitter on a full finish. Drink now.

88,Marisco Vineyards 2017 The Ned Pinot Gris (Marlborough),"Left for a spell on the skins, this pink-hued Pinot Gris could be easily mistaken for a rosé.

88,Messina Hof 2016 Private Reserve Double Barrel Tempranillo (Texas High Plains),"An earthy nose of lush green moss, ferns and tilled earth carries a subtle hint of wild blackberry.

88,Paul Cheneau NV Lady of Spain Brut Sparkling (Cava),"Briny lime aromas are slightly yeasty but mostly clean and fresh.

88,Peregrine 2016 Pinot Gris (Central Otago),"A little oniony, salty and reductive at the start, with some swirls in glass this wine offers delicate aromas of lemon and lime. Typical to this variety and style, its texture is creamy, woven nicely between crunchy—if a little austere—acidity and a salty bitter-almond finish. On the premium end both in price and style, this is one for the dinner table rather than for sipping solo.

86,Gambino 2015 Tifeo Rosso  (Etna),"This has aromas of French oak, prune, underbrush and vanilla. Reflecting the nose, the lean, light-bodied palate evokes coconut, espresso and a hint of dried berry alongside dusty, rather fleeting tannins that leave a drying, astringent finish.

86,Bodega Volcanes de Chile 2016 Tectonia Chardonnay (Malleco),"Fully toasted oak aromas are smoky and grainy, and they cover up briny apple notes. A mix of oily weight and sharp acidity defines the palate, while this tastes a bit sour, with lots of oak attached to stone fruit flavors. Hailing from southerly Malleco, this is a cool-climate Chardonnay, and thus the high acid level makes sense.

86,Casa Donoso 2017 Bicentenario Gran Reserva Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Aggressive aromas of gamy berry fruits are slightly green.

90,William Chris 2015 Lost Draw Vineyards Mourvèdre (Texas High Plains),"Herbal aromas of bay leaves and hops are alluring on the nose of this Texas Mourvèdre. The extremely juicy palate dances on the firm structure of fine-grained tannins.

84,Calcu 2015 Reserva Especial Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Leafy berry aromas are lacking in purity, letting you know more or less where this is headed.

84,Cantine di Ora 2017 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),"Light-bodied and simple, this has subdued aromas suggesting mature orchard fruit.

84,Casas del Bosque 2016 Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"A gold color and a blowsy nose with oak but not much fruit or freshness form the opening to this shaky but decent Chardonnay. A chunky, pulpy palate and woody flavors of stale stone fruit and citrus finish with little more than a hint of vanilla.

84,Lewis Grace 2016 Barbera (Amador County),"A strong spicy oaky aroma is followed by equally strong oak flavors, so this medium-bodied wine is one-dimensional, without the fruit character that most people like to taste in their wines.

83,Amalur 2016 Single Vineyard Reserva Pinot Noir (Colchagua Valley),"Grassy aromas include notes of green herb and bell pepper.

83,Carmen 2017 Wave Series Right Wave Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),"Dusty berry aromas are basic and bland. This feels creamy, sticky and candied.

83,Chilcas 2017 Reserva Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Lolol Valley),"Herbaceous notes of juniper and eucalyptus push the limits of what's acceptable in terms of green aromas.

83,Fitz Roy 2017 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"A yeasty nose is less than fresh and indicates a wine in decline. A grabby palate with the feel of grape skins tastes wheaty, grassy and fruitless.

83,Juvé & Camps 2017 Gregal D'Espiells White (Penedès),"This blend of Gewürztraminer, Malvasia and Muscat is highly aromatic but not at ease, meaning the nose is soapy and smells unnatural.
